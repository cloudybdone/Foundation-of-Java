### What is Java?
 Java is a cross-platform object-oriented programming language that was released by Sun Microsystems in the year 1995. It is similar to C++, but with advanced and simplified features. This language is free to access and can run on all platforms.

 Java is: –

  1. **Concurrent** where you can execute many statements instead of sequentially executing it.
  2. **Class-based** and an **object-oriented** programming language.
  3. **Independent** programming language that follows the logic of **“Write once, Run anywhere”** i.e. the compiled code can run on all platforms which supports java.

### What is Java used for? 

It is highly popular and has dominated this field from early 2000’s till the present 2022.
    
Some of the applications are listed below:-

 * **Banking:** To deal with transaction management.
 * **Retail:** Billing applications that you see in a store/restaurant are completely written in Java.
 * **Information Technology:** Java is designed to solve implementation dependencies.
 * **Android:** Applications are either written in Java or use Java API.
 * **Financial services:** It is used in server-side applications.
 * **Stock market:** To write algorithms as to which company they should invest in.  
 * **Big Data:** Hadoop MapReduce framework is written using Java.
 * **Scientific and Research Community:** To deal with huge amount of data.

### Short History 

Java is a programming language developed by **James Gosling** with other team members named **Mike Sheridan** and **Patrick Naughton** also called as **Green Team** in **1995** for **Sun Microsystems** for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions etc. Now, let us explore the language in detail.

### Features

**Simple:** Java has made life easier by removing all the complexities such as pointers, operator overloading as you see in C++ or any other programming language.

**Portable:** This is platform independent which means that any application written on one platform can be easily ported to another platform.

**Object-oriented:** Everything is considered to be an “object” which possess some state, behavior and all the operations are performed using these objects. 

**Secured:** All the code is converted in **bytecode** after compilation, which is not readable by a human. and java does not use an explicit pointer and run the programs inside the sandbox to prevent any activities from untrusted sources. It enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems/applications.

**Dynamic:** It has the ability to adapt to an evolving environment which supports dynamic memory allocation due to which memory wastage is reduced and performance of the application is increased.

**Distributed:** This language provides a feature which helps to create distributed applications. Using Remote Method Invocation (RMI), a program can invoke a method of another program across a network and get the output. You can access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.

**Robust:** Java has a strong memory management system. It helps in eliminating error as it checks the code during compile and runtime.

**High Performance:** Java achieves high performance through the use of bytecode which can be easily translated into native machine code. With the use of **JIT (Just-In-Time) compilers**, it enables high performance.

**Multithreaded:** Java supports multiple threads of execution (a.k.a., lightweight processes), including a set of synchronization primitives. This makes programming with threads much easier.
