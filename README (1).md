### What is Java?
 Java is a cross-platform object-oriented programming language that was released by Sun Microsystems in the year 1995. It is similar to C++, but with advanced and simplified features. This language is free to access and can run on all platforms.

 Java is: –

    2. **Class-based** and an **object-oriented** programming language.
    3. **Independent** programming language that follows the logic of **“Write once, Run anywhere”** i.e. the compiled code can run on all platforms which supports java.
